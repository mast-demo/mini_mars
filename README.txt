you must add the models directory to the GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH
assume that the models directory it at /home/jmwest/mars_ws/src/mini_mars/models

to do it once, type:
GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=$GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH:/home/jmwest/mars_ws/src/mini_mars/models
to have it automatically added to your environment, add that to the end of your
~/.bashrc file
